He took my suggestions of how to improve the design and used the nessacary shopify apps to gain the functionality i required in the store. He went as far to reach out to app developers to ensure the app was performing exactly as i wanted it to and didnt stop until i was satisfied. over all a great experience. I will work with him again.'
